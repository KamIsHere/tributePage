    <p>Kevin Durant is an All Around great person, not only to the game of basketball,
       but also to his community. Throughout his NBA carreer he has continued to be as
       humbled as to when he first signed his NBA contract. In 2013, Durant donated $1
       million to help with relief following a devastating tornado in the OKC area.
       In 2015, NIKE, Inc., Kevin Durant & The Kevin Durant Charity Foundation (kcdf)
       partnered to create the BUILD IT AND THEY WILL BALL Courts Renovation Initiative
       to increase the number of high quality basketball courts accessible to
       underprivileged youth across the United States and internationally.
       In 2016, kcdf built 2 new Basketball courts in the Oakland area of
       California (Lincoln Park Community Center). If you would like to
       know more about the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation or make a donation
